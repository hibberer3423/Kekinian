              <p class="f-one">
                Yasa Paramita Singgih, a young man born on April 23, 1995 from Bekasi, was born from a simple family. He never aspired to be an entrepreneur. Because his parents work in an office like most people. The world he knows is graduating from high school, studying, working, then becoming a manager. When Yasa was in the third grade of junior high school, the father was hospitalized due to a heart attack that blocked his four veins. The mother then decides to ring surgery. However, the father refused this and chose to use the money for his children's school needs. That moment became a turning point that changed Yasa's life. He began earning his own money by working part-time at a number of EOs owned by his friends and became a master of ceremonies (MC) at various birthday events, music, competitions, talk shows to seminars. At the age of 15, he began selling online lighting, but soon his business closed because the distributor was unable to deliver more goods. As a result, at the age of 16 years, Yasa decided to drive to the fashion business. Through the parents of his good friends who have a convection business, he finally became interested in selling t-shirts.

              <br>
              <p class="f-two">
                   He tried to make his own drawing designs for t-shirts, even though he had no knowledge at all about the ins and outs of t-shirts or designs. With an initial capital of around Rp. 700 thousand, he began selling the shirts he designed. But unfortunately the shirt he sold did not sell. Then, he learned again how to sell T-shirts so he finally decided to take the goods in Tanah Abang. He uses the name Men’s Republic as the name of his online store, with marketing through blogs, Twitter, BBM. The fashion business was on the rise so that it had enough capital to open a new business in the culinary field. He opened a beverage business called "This Coffee Tea" in 2012, a tavern business selling durian coffee drinks in the Kebun Jeruk area. About six months later he has opened a new branch precisely at the Ambassador Mall in South Jakarta. But unfortunately the new business he managed went bankrupt which made him suffer losses of up to Rp100 million. In 2013, he decided to close the cafe, and even his t-shirt business was also stopped.

              <p class="f-three">
                      Bankruptcy experienced does not make Yasa despair in doing business. At the age of 19, after the State Examination was over, he rose again with his fashion business. This time he rose with a clear concept as well as a neatly arranged business plan.
Come up with the concept of making a fashion brand specifically for young men, middle class and the price is under Rp500,000, and go online but the quality of the mall with the price of the online shop. So he raised the Men’s Republic flag again. At first, Yasa only sold casual shoes for men. But the greater the effort to make the brand he manages, the more it offers a variety of products. At present, Men’s Republic sells men's underwear, jackets and sandals for men. Now, Men’s Republic products have sold 500 pairs of shoes per month. Without a Yasa factory, it is able to produce a turnover of hundreds of millions of rupiah. From this business he was able to get a 40% net profit. Not satisfied with the product now, there are still thoughts on his mind to sell belt products, and pants. The surest is that he will continue to mature the concept of business while walking.

At the age of 19, he founded a company called PT Paramita Singgih to overshadow his business. He wants to make the label Men’s Republic a provider of all men's needs from head to toe. Currently, Yasa is studying at Bina Nusantara University majoring in marketing communication.
