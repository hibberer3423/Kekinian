                The beginning of his success story began when he was in elementary school. Since elementary school he has had the soul of a businessman by selling various toys at his school. Stepping on junior high he also sells clothes at his school to step on high school he kept trying by following various types of MLM to Insurance. For him it all did not make him afraid or even ashamed. Nicholas came from a modest family and even in a period of his life, his father often got scolded for borrowing money here and there. His father and mother often fought over financial problems. In fact he was forced to lie to his tutor by saying that his tutoring money was used by him even though his parents could not give him the tutoring money. That is why he is not afraid or even ashamed to try to find money since he was a child. He started as a fish exporter when he was in high school. At that time he was given a garra rufa fish by a friend. Because he was not very interested in taking care of fish, he took the initiative to sell it at the FJB Kaskus. After a few minutes he advertised it, there were quite a lot of offers. He also thought to find a cheap fish seller and sell it back. From there his business began until finally he was able to raise money to 10 million at the age of 17 years. But he accepted the bitter reality because he was declared not to go up to grade 3, whereas previously he had very proud achievements both academic and non-academic.

              <p class="f-two">
                   It was then that he was devastated and finally he moved schools and used the 10 million to reduce his embarrassment because he did not go up in class. Even so he continued to try because he had the ideals of studying at Prasetiya Mulya Business School BSD. But for college there the cost required is not small. Total costs in semester 1 reached 100 million rupiah. His parents could not even afford the desire of his child. But he did not give up, he began to learn how to become an exporter. The scolding even curses he got from the people he visited to study to become an exporter. But eventually he gradually became a good exporter. He has also been cheated by his partners for 30 million rupiah. Even though the money is his savings for college. But it wasn't Nicholas if he gave up so quickly that finally when he entered the final wave of registration, the 100 million was collected and he was able to study there. Not only can college at their own expense but can become a very inspiring young entrepreneur. I myself was very motivated by the story of his life's journey, when he was very bad even though he could still rise and even get back to the top. A child who has been willing to try since he was little just to want to help his parents. A child who has ideals and tries hard to be able to achieve those goals even though it is somewhat impossible. But thanks to the hard work of prayer and unyielding, nothing is impossible to do.
